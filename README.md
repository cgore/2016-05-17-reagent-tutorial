# reagent-tutorial
This is a basic workthrough tutorial project for
[ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)
using
[Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/).

There is a nice short tutorial [here](https://holmsand.github.io/reagent/).

This was created with the lein
[reagent-template](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-template)
plugin by:

```bash
lein new reagent reagent-tutorial
```

You can launch [lein figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) by

```bash
cd reagent-tutorial; lein figwheel
```

and then eventually connect at
[localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
